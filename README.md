MUSE-XAE is a user-friendly tool powered by the robust capabilities of autoencoder neural networks, allowing for the extraction and visualization of mutational signatures present in a tumor catalog. MUSE-XAE consists of a hybrid denoising autoencoder with a nonlinear encoder that enables the learning of nonlinear interactions and a linear decoder that ensures interpretability. Based on the conducted experiments, MUSE-XAE has proven to be one of the most performant and accurate tools in extracting mutational patterns.
